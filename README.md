# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS LIZARD SPOCK

My very first app created completely from scratch and without any instructions.  I'm thinking of this as a time capsule.  I am sure I will look back on this in a few weeks, months, years, and be amazed at how rinky-dink it is.  

My plan is to get it to work across different machines so people can use it with each other on their phones.  I do not have the skills for that yet - I have no idea where the answers would get stored, etc.  But I should figure it out eventually - if I even ever come back to this rather pointless exercise.
